Thank you for reading this.

Actually, Hinode-AI is a personal project. There are still parts that haven't been developed yet.

If possible, please help in one of the following ways:
1. Simple: Please give it a star.
2. For programmers/engineers: Help with code fixes or testing.
3. For those who can support Hinode-AI's future: Publish the trained models on HuggingFace. However, please include information about the Hinode-AI project. For more details, see [Help with Trained Model](Help/Training.md).
